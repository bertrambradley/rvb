HackRF One Software Defined Radio (SDR) & ANT Antenna Bundle. How do i get gps-sdr-sim to work longer than seconds? need to get signal to a femtocell. Hacker de Cabecera ju brdc, GPS, gps-sdr-sim, HackRF, and I've been wanting to share with you for a long time one of those projects related. ZED-F9T; HackRF One; gps-sdr-sim; almanac and ephemeris files; Multi-band GNSS jammer; U-Center.

First, a method of GPS signal spooÔ¨Ång with SDR platform is introduced and demonstrated. A software deÔ¨Åned radio platform is required to complete this attack. Faked GPS baseband signal samples are generated using an open source project, and replayed using SDR platform such as HackRF, BladeRF or USRP. The time of affected devices is altered as well. ¬†¬∑ In the video TechMinds uses the GPS-SDR-SIM software with his HackRF to create a fake GPS signal in order to trick his Android phone into believing that it is in Kansas city. In the past we've seen GPS Spoofing used in various experiments by security ted Reading Time: 30 secs. ¬†¬∑ To do this he used the off the shelf " GPS-SDR-Sim " software by Takuji Ebinuma which is a GPS Spoofing tool for transmit capable SDR's like the HackRF, bladeRF and USRP radios. At first, when using the software Stefan noticed that the HackRF was simply jamming his GPS signals, and not simulating the satellites.
