  As shared in a report, AT&T was recently involved in a similar hack. The report shares that there are 70 million AT&T customers who had their personal data. So my Att account is hacked. When I log in they ask me to verify the code sent to my phone knowing they have had the service turned off by. I have ONLY 1 cell phone/number on my plan. I am asking you to figure out WHO is hacking my phone, changed my passwords, playing games.
